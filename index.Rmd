```


COVID-19 has caused major social, economic, and political disruptions around the world. This project examines the impact of COVID-19 in Uganda’s capital city, Kampala. We conduct a set of surveys with a representative sample of around 2700 Kampala residents to study the social, health, and economic impact of COVID-19, and to assess levels of knowledge about COVID-19, compliance with public health policies, and citizens’ perceptions of government performance. The surveys will be conducted by phone between June 2020 and September 2020 and results will be regularly updated on this dashboard as they become available.

## Team

We are a team including experts in the fields of economics, health, and political science. Our team has experience conducting research across sub-Saharan Africa, and over 15 years of research experience in Uganda specifically. The survey is implemented by Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) Uganda. This survey on COVID-19 builds on an existing project in collaboration with the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA).
